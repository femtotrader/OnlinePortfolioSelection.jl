# Benchmark Strategies
Some strategies in the context of online portfolio selection are considered as benchmark strategies. The simplest benchmark strategy is the Buy and Hold (BH) strategy which is called as the *market strategy*. The BAH model invests equally in m assets at the beginning and remains unchanged during the next periods, thus the weights of assets change passively with their price variations. A special BAH model, the Best-Stock (BS), invests all the capital into the best asset over the periods which is an optimal BAH in hindsight. Overall, the Benchmark portfolio selection models are quite simple because they do not adopt complex or sophisticated techniques via statistics and machine learning to explore the patterns within the data. Thus they are often taken as the baselines for performance comparison with new designed models. Another benchmark strategy is the Constant Rebalanced Portfolio (CRP) which assigns a fixed weight to each asset throughout a given period.
