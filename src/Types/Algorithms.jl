"""
    OPSAlgorithm{T<:Float64}

A `OPSAlgorithm` object that contains the result of running the algorithm.

# Fields
- `n_asset::Int`: Number of assets in the portfolio.
- `b::Matrix{T}`: Weights of the created portfolios.
- `alg::String`: Name of the algorithm.

The formula for calculating the cumulative return of the portfolio is as follows:

```math
{S_n} = {S_0}\\prod\\limits_{t = 1}^T {\\left\\langle {{b_t},{x_t}} \\right\\rangle }
```

where ``Sâ‚€`` is the initial budget, ``n`` is the investment horizon, ``b_t`` is the vector \
of weights of the period ``t``, and ``x_t`` is the relative price of the ``t``-th period.
